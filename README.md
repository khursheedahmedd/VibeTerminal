# Vibe Terminal - AI Terminal Assistant

Vibe Terminal is a terminal-based AI assistant designed to help you with shell commands, answer questions, and eventually act as an intelligent agent in your terminal. Built with Trae AI IDE and powered by Novita's advanced language models.

This is an early version focusing on core functionality with Novita and LangGraph.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- A Novita AI API Key (Get it from: https://novita.ai/settings/key-management)
- For voice mode:
  - PyAudio
  - A working microphone
  - Internet connection (for speech recognition)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    https://github.com/khursheedahmedd/vibe-terminal.git
    cd sadain-cli
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install the package locally for development:**

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

    This makes the `sadain` command available in your current environment.

5.  **Set your Novita AI API Key:**
    - Create a file named `.env` in the project root (`sadain_cli/.env`) OR in `~/.config/sadain/.env`
    - Add your API key to it:
      ```
      NOVITA_API_KEY="your_actual_novita_api_key"
      ```
    - Alternatively, Sadain will prompt you for the key on first run if it's not found.
